# Queue Management System (Web-Based)
## Problem Statement

Physical queues in places such as clinics, college offices, food counters, and help desks often lead to overcrowding, long waiting times, and inefficiency. Managing unpredictable service times makes the experience uncomfortable for both users and administrators.

## Proposed Solution

A **web-based digital queue management system** that allows users to join queues remotely using a **Queue ID / QR**, removing the need for physical waiting.

The system:
- Works on any device with a browser  
- Requires no app installation  
- Is easy to deploy and manage  

Users receive a digital token and can track their position in real time, while administrators manage queues through a simple interface.

## Motivation

Most existing queue systems rely on dedicated hardware and complex setups, making them unsuitable for small-scale or temporary use.

This solution:
- Requires no hardware  
- Is low-cost and fast to deploy  
- Improves accessibility and user experience
